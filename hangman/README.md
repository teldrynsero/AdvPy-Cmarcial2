## RUN
- Open command prompt and navigate to the "hangman" folder
- Run hangman.py using "Python hangman.py"

## PLAY
- Make sure to input your name (option D on main menu) before playing (option A), or else your stats won't have your name attached
- Game requires one (1) human player
- Computer will randomly choose a word out of a list of 20
- Goal is to guess this word, one letter at a time, before the stick-man is hung and "dies"
- Win if entire word guessed and hangman isn't fully drawn; lose if entire word not guessed and hangman is fully drawn
- Secret words only contain letters (numbers and symbols are invalid guesses)
- Player stats (total games played, won, and lost) are recorded in stats.txt after game ends
